## üîß Backend Planning & Technology Decisions

### Framework Decision Status: **UNDER CONSIDERATION**

**Options Evaluated:**
- **Laravel (PHP)** - Full framework with built-in features, but potentially heavy for 1 CPU + 6GB RAM setup
- **Lumen (PHP)** - Micro-framework, but Laravel team no longer recommends for new projects (deprecated for new development)
- **Vanilla PHP** - Leading candidate for maximum resource efficiency and full architectural control

**Resource Constraints Consideration:**
- **VM Specs**: VM.Standard.A1.Flex with 1 CPU + 6GB RAM (ARM architecture)
- **Memory efficiency** crucial for optimal performance
- **Vanilla PHP**: ~15-25MB memory usage vs Lumen ~25-40MB vs Laravel ~50-70MB

**Development Approach:**
- **AI-assisted development** significantly reduces vanilla PHP development time disadvantage
- **Learning value** of building custom architecture from scratch
- **Portfolio differentiation** through custom-built backend

**Decision Pending:** Final framework choice weighing resource efficiency vs development convenience

### Database Decision Status: **UNDER CONSIDERATION**

**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Options:**
- **MySQL (HeatWave)** - Familiar syntax, 50GB always free, perfect Laravel integration
- **Oracle Autonomous Database** - Enterprise features, 20GB always free, portfolio differentiation
- **NoSQL** - Considered but deemed overkill for relational data structure

**Key Considerations:**
- **Development Speed** vs **Portfolio Impact**
- **Familiar MySQL** vs **Learning Oracle DB**
- **Laravel Integration** ease and compatibility

**Decision Pending:** Database choice balancing development efficiency with portfolio enhancement

### Contact Form Security Architecture: **DEFINED**

**Anti-Spam Strategy Decided:**
- **Database Storage** - Store messages in database instead of email to prevent spam
- **Multi-layer Protection** required:
  - Rate limiting (5 requests per minute per IP)
  - Google reCAPTCHA v3 (invisible, score-based)
  - Content filtering for spam keywords
  - Honeypot fields for bot detection
  - IP logging and tracking

**Data Privacy Implementation:**
- **Public API Data** - Name, title, tagline, summary, city-level location, social links, skills, projects, education, experience
- **Private Contact Data** - Email, phone, full address (admin-only access)
- **Contact Messages** - Stored with IP address, user agent, timestamp for security

### Deployment Strategy: **PLANNED**

**Phased Approach Decided:**
1. **Phase 1: Kubernetes Learning** - Deploy on OCI Kubernetes Engine for hands-on container orchestration experience
2. **Phase 2: VM Migration** - Move to dedicated VM.Standard.A1.Flex (1 CPU + 6GB RAM, always free) for long-term cost efficiency

**Benefits:**
- K8s experience for portfolio and DevOps skills demonstration
- Cost optimization for long-term hosting
- Scalability options for future growth

### Outstanding Decisions Required:

1. **Framework Final Choice** - Vanilla PHP vs Laravel (Lumen deprecated for new projects)
2. **Database Selection** - MySQL vs Oracle DB based on learning goals vs development speed
3. **Development Environment Setup** - Local development stack configuration
4. **API Endpoint Design** - Detailed endpoint specifications and data contracts
5. **Security Implementation** - Specific reCAPTCHA integration and rate limiting configuration
6. **Admin Panel Development** - Shared component package structure and admin app implementation

## üîê Admin Panel Architecture Considerations

### Flutter Admin Panel Implementation: **DECIDED - SEPARATE APPS**

**Architecture Decision: Separate Flutter Applications**

**Chosen Architecture:**
```
Portfolio App (Public)          Admin App (Private)             Backend API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ No admin routes             ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Complete admin functionality  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Portfolio API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ No admin dependencies       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin-specific packages      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Admin API  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clean public bundle         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Secure authentication flow   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Auth system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Zero admin exposure risk    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IP whitelisting capability   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Role-based access

netanelk.com                    admin.netanelk.com              api.netanelk.com
```

**Security Benefits (Primary Reason for Decision):**
- **Complete code isolation** - Zero chance of admin code leaking to public app
- **Independent deployment** - Admin on secure subdomain with different policies
- **Separate security zones** - Admin behind VPN/IP restrictions, portfolio public
- **Clean public bundle** - No admin overhead affecting portfolio performance
- **Easier compliance** - Simpler to audit and secure separate applications

**Development & Maintenance Advantages:**
- **Clear separation of concerns** - Portfolio vs admin logic completely separate
- **Independent testing** - Admin functionality tested in isolation
- **Shared components** - Common widgets extracted to shared package
- **Consistent theming** - Same design system across both apps
- **Update isolation** - Can update admin without affecting portfolio

**Project Structure Decision:**
```
netanel-homepage/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ portfolio-web/           # Current portfolio project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-panel/            # New separate admin app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-components/      # Common Flutter widgets/models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/               # PHP API serving both apps
```

**Security Implementation Strategy:**
- **Multi-layer admin authentication** - JWT + session management + IP whitelisting
- **Role-based API access** - Separate admin endpoints with enhanced validation
- **Audit logging** - Comprehensive tracking of all admin actions
- **Secure deployment** - Admin app on private subdomain with VPN requirements
